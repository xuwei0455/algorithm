/**********************************************************************************
*
* Given an array of citations (each citation is a non-negative integer) of a researcher,
* write a function to compute the researcher's h-index.
*
* According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: "A scientist has index h if h of
* his/her N papers have at least h citations each, and the other N âˆ’ h papers have no more
* than h citations each."
*
* For example, given citations = [3, 0, 6, 1, 5], which means the researcher has 5 papers
* in total and each of them had received 3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations respectively. Since the
* researcher has 3 papers with at  *least 3 citations each and the remaining two with no more
* than 3 citations each, his h-index is 3.
*
* Note: If there are several possible values for h, the maximum one is taken as the h-index.
*

* Special thanks to @jianchao.li.fighter for adding this problem and creating all test cases.

/*
* Solutions
* =========
*
* A simple solution would be to sort the vector and then run through it starting with
* the last element. At every step we need to check whether this element is not less than
* the remaining number of elements bigger than it(including itself) and all the values of
* the other elements smaller than it are not more than that number. The h_index is this
* number of elements bigger than it(including itself).
*
* Time Complexity: O(N log N)
* Space Complexity: O(1)
